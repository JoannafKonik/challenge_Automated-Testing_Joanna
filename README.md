### Why did I decide to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?
I decided to take part in Dare IT Challenge "QA Automated Testing" because I would like to take my testing skills to the next level. Six month ago I was a part of "Become a Manual Tester" Challenge and it was very inspiring journey. Hope that this time will be the same.

I am open to learn new tools and technical skills. I believe that this Challenge will allow me to move forward in my present job.

Last but not least I would like to proof that age and place where I am living are not the limit :rocket:

Good day :deciduous_tree: Joanna
